### App Name
Wealth Tracker

### Subtitle (30 characters max)
Simple Self-Hosted Net Worth

### Promotional Text (170 characters max)
A simple, self-hosted net worth tracker. See all your accounts in one place, track your balance over time, and keep your financial data on your own server - fully private.

### Description (4000 characters max, no unicode)

Ever wondered "how much do I actually have?" Wealth Tracker is a simple app that answers that question. Add your bank accounts, savings, investments, and retirement funds, and see your total net worth on a single screen. No spreadsheets, no complexity - just a clear number and a chart showing how it changes over time.

HOW IT WORKS
Wealth Tracker takes regular snapshots of your account balances. Over time, this builds a history that shows how your net worth grows (or dips). Think of it as a weighing scale for your finances - step on it regularly and watch the trend.

You can enter balances manually or connect supported accounts to sync automatically.

SELF-HOSTED - YOUR DATA, YOUR SERVER
Unlike other finance apps, Wealth Tracker does not store your data on someone else's cloud. You host the backend yourself. That means:
- Your financial data never leaves your control
- No company can sell, leak, or lose your information
- You decide where your data lives and who has access
- The app works with your own server - set it up once and you are good to go

BUILT FOR SECURITY
Your finances deserve serious protection:
- Per-user encryption: each account has its own encryption key derived from your password
- Ephemeral login tokens: credentials are never stored on the server after authentication
- Biometric unlock (Face ID, Touch ID) for quick but secure access
- All communication encrypted via TLS
- No ads, no tracking, no data sharing

CONNECT YOUR ACCOUNTS
Sync balances automatically from supported institutions:
- German banks via FinTS/HBCI
- Interactive Brokers (IBKR)
- TrueWealth (Swiss robo-advisor)
- VIAC (Swiss 3a retirement)
- Morgan Stanley at Work
- Or simply add any account manually

MULTI-CURRENCY SUPPORT
Have accounts in different currencies? No problem. Wealth Tracker fetches exchange rates automatically and shows everything in your preferred base currency.

CLEAN AND SIMPLE
- One dashboard with your total net worth
- A chart showing your wealth over time
- List of all accounts with their latest balances
- No bloat, no ads, no upsells

PERFECT FOR
- Anyone who wants to know their net worth at a glance
- People with accounts at multiple banks or brokers
- Privacy-conscious users who want to own their data
- Expats with finances in different countries
- Anyone saving toward a goal and wanting to see progress

Wealth Tracker is not a budgeting app and does not track individual transactions. It simply answers: "What is my net worth today, and how has it changed?"

Download it, point it at your server, and start tracking.
